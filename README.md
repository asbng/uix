## What is UIX?

UIX is a fullstack web framework that allows you to create reactive web apps with restorable and shared state.
UIX supports both single- and multi page applications with frontend or server-side rendering and uses modern web app features.

There are four main ways to design UIX components and create UIX applications:
 * using the **TypeScript UIX Library** and JSX (focus of the documentation)
 * using the **UIX Web Editor** (still in development)
 * writing **HTML** markup
 * defining UIX states with **DATEX**

The whole UIX library is designed with a modular approach
that makes it very easy for developers to add their own custom
components as needed.

## UIX-DOM

The UIX fullstack framework is built ontop of [UIX-DOM](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix-dom),
a standalone library that allows you to define reactive DOM elements on the frontend and backend.

The fullstack UIX framework provides many more features, but if you just need a basic reactive DOM library,
you can take a look at UIX-DOM.
