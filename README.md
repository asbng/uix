## What is UIX?
[UIX](https://uix.unyt.org) is a modern open-source full-stack web framework for developing reactive web apps with *restorable and shared state*.
UIX supports both *single- and multi page* applications with frontend or server-side rendering including hydration and uses state-of-the-art web features.

The [DATEX JavaScript Library](https://docs.unyt.org/manual/datex/introduction) acts as the backbone of UIX, providing usefull functionality such as *reactivity and cross-device data exchange*.
In contrast to frameworks like React, UIX provides *direct wiring* to the DOM for reactivity and does not need a virtual DOM.

There are many ways to create UIX applications:
 * using the **TypeScript UIX Library** and JSX (focus of the documentation)
 * defining UIX states with **DATEX**
 * using the **UIX Web Editor** (still in development)

The UIX library is designed in a modular approach that makes it easy for developers to add custom components and logic as needed.



**Main features**
 * Cross-network reactivity
 * Server side rendering with partial hydration
 * Hybrid backend/frontend routing
 * Cross-realm imports
 * Shared memory
 * JSX support
 * Reusable Web Components
 * SCSS support
 * [And many more](https://uix.unyt.org)...

UIX aims to simplify all phases of the app development cycle, including design, development, testing and distribution, in order to make the developer experience as convenient as possible. 
This is why UIX ships with integrated features such as:
 * Hot reloading
 * Testing library
 * Stage management
 * Version management
 * Automated deployment

## UIX DOM

The UIX full-stack framework is built on top of [UIX DOM](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix-dom),
a standalone library that allows you to define reactive DOM elements on the frontend and backend.

The full-stack UIX framework provides many more features, but if you just need a basic reactive DOM library,
you can take a look at UIX DOM.
